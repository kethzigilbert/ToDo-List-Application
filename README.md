This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installing Node
To install Node on your machine, go to https://nodejs.org and click on the Download button. Depending on your computer's platform (Windows, MacOS or Linux), the appropriate installation package is downloaded.
Follow along the instructions to install Node on your machine. 
Note: On Windows machines, you may need to configure your PATH environmental variable in case you forgot to turn on the add to PATH during the installation steps.

## Verifying the Node Installation
Open a terminal window on your machine. If you are using a Windows machine, open a cmd window or PowerShell window with admin privileges.
To ensure that your NodeJS setup is working correctly, type the following at the command prompt to check for the version of Node and NPM
```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

### Installing json-server
json-server is a node module, and hence can be installed globally by typing the following at the command prompt:
```bash
npm install json-server -g
```
### Configuring the Server
Move to the folder name 'json-server' in your terminal window, and type the following at the command prompt to start the server:
```bash
json-server --watch db_task.json -p 3001 
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### npm install
Install the dependencies in the local node_modules folder.

In global mode (ie, with -g or --global appended to the command), it installs the current package context (ie, the current working directory) as a global package.

By default, npm install will install all modules listed as dependencies in package.json.

With the --production flag (or when the NODE_ENV environment variable is set to production), npm will not install modules listed in devDependencies.

NOTE: The --production flag has no particular meaning when adding a dependency to a project.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
